 Movie Recommendation based on Collaborative Filtering 
 
 This repository recommends movies for users based on ratings for 1700 movies by 1000 users.
 The data for this project can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
 
 The movie recommendation can be made two ways:
 
 1) User-based Collaborative filtering 
 For each user, movies with high ratings from similar users are recommended. Ex: Users similar to you also liked………….
 
 2) Item-based Collaborative filtering 
 Will find users who like a movie, and recommend movies like by these users and other similar users. Ex: Users who liked this item also liked…
