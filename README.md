 This repository recommends movies for users based on ratings for 1700 movies by 1000 users.
 The data for this project can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
 
 The movie recommendation can be made two ways
 
 1) User-based Collaborative filtering 
 For each user, movies with high ratings from similar users are recommended 
 
 2) Item based Collaborative filtering 
 Will find users who like a movie, and recommend movies like by these users and other similar users
